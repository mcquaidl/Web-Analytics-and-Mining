nodes.info <- do.call("rbind", lapply(data$nodes, data.frame))    #put nodes info into a data frame
head(nodes.info)    #check the nodes.info variable that was created

##Part 1
#a) Using the aggregate function, or appropriate code from the tidyverse, compute the data frame for 
##the total players joining each month. Names the columns as Month and Joining.
month.join <- aggregate(nodes.info$joining, by=list(nodes.info$month),     #create the variable using the aggregate function
                FUN = sum)    #function is 'sum' to add the players joined
colnames(month.join) <- c('Month', 'Joining')    #change the column names
month.join    #check

#b)Using the aggregate function, or appropriate code from the tidyverse, compute the data 
#frame for the total players departing each month. Names the columns as Month and Departing.
month.depart<- aggregate(nodes.info$departing, by=list(nodes.info$month),     #create the variable using the aggregate function
                        FUN = sum)    #function is 'sum' to add the players departing
colnames(month.depart) <- c('Month', 'Departing')    #change the column names
month.depart    #check

#c) Merge the two data frames by Month column, using the merge function with the sort option
#as FALSE, or appropriate code from the tidyverse.
month.jd <- merge(month.join, month.depart, by = 'Month', sort = FALSE)    #merge the two data frames
month.jd


#d) Use appropriate data visualization principles to compare the joining and departing data. 
month.jd.chart <- gvisColumnChart(month.jd,   #creation of the chart with the depart and join data
                                  xvar='Month',    #determining of the x axis

#e) Use appropriate data visualization principles to explore the trend in departing data.

line.depart <- gvisLineChart(month.depart,    #creation of the line chart with the departure data

                             ))
plot(line.depart)    #open google viz

#f) Modify your chart from part (e) in some way that focuses on and/or identifies the months with the 
#least departures (you donâ€™t want to lose players).
 
#find the lowest departure rates
sort(month.depart$Departing)

month.depart %>% 
  mutate(highlight_flag = ifelse(month.depart$Departing <= '1200', T, F)) %>%     #creating a flag for the lowest occurring 
  ggplot(aes(x = month.depart$Month, y= month.depart$Departing)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = highlight_flag), stat = 'identity') +    #change the stat to identity to make sure it is picking up the values from the departures 
  labs(x = 'Months'   #labeling the x axis
       ,y = 'Number of Departures'   #labeling the y axis
       ,title = str_c("Number of Player Departures Over Time")   #adding a title
